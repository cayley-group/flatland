    "# Data Generation with Flatland\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook begins to outline how training datasets will be generated in Flatland. This notebook will evolve into a documentation of how to use the tool through a more formal and simplified API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here's the idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Some modern protein structure prediction approaches are a little bit complicated to implement. That's why it seems useful to have a simulator that can generate data at least of the same structure that researchers seek to use in such systems. Over time, these simulators can be improved progressively to add some minimal level of realism that should be helpful for initial model debugging. This might include for example modifying simulation parameters to enable a model to train effectively then returning to the more complex form once the simpler problem has been solved. Thus we hope to create a much more smooth path to solving the larger problem than is often followed by those seeking to solve it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, even when training larger systems on real data it will be important that system components remain integrated and both the system and its individual components continue to function correctly. Simple toy test cases are often used for this purpose in software test engineering. But in the case of ML software engineering, sometimes it helps if these are slightly realistic. Even further, we are interested in understanding the potential of various additional sources of data to enhance the performance of structure prediction systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will evolve populations of polymers using a trivially simple fitness metric and in the course of that retain a \"genetic history\" of the evolved populations. Then, we will compute structures for these polymers using Jax MD. For each \"solved\" structure we will compute a pairwise \"residue\" distance matrix and a vector of \"bond\" angles. Lastly, we will simulate a compound-protein interaction experiment again using Jax MD.\n"
